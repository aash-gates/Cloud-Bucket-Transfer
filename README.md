# HTML/JS Program to Upload Files to S3 Bucket

This is a simple HTML/JS program that allows you to upload files to an S3 bucket using the AWS SDK. It uses a form to collect the file and AWS credentials from the user and uploads the file to the specified bucket. The program requires the user to have an AWS account with access to an S3 bucket.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, you must have the following:

- An AWS account with access to an S3 bucket
- AWS access key and secret access key
- AWS region where the S3 bucket is located
- Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript

## How to Use

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Fill in the form fields with the S3 bucket name, AWS region, AWS access key, and AWS secret access key.
4. Select a file to upload using the file input field.
5. Click the "Upload File" button to upload the file to the specified S3 bucket.
6. Wait for the success or failure message to appear.
